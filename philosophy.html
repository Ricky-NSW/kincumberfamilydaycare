        <h1>My Professional Philosophy</h1>
        <p>Family Daycare is a rewarding and challenging position. Being an educator is not about holding power over children. As an educator, you can help facilitate your children’s minds by providing them with contextual knowledge and information. I believe an educator can also learn from the children in their care as children bring their own background knowledge and ideas to the activities and learning experiences being applied. I am a Family Daycare educator so I can give all children an equal opportunity to learn by implementing their interests and ideas into my programming strategies and activities. This is rewarding as you watch children progress and enhance their understanding, as they become more knowledgeable. Children need to feel heard, respected, identified and given a voice within the service to create an environment where they can satisfy their needs through activities and not through disruptive behaviour. By allowing them to have a variety of choices in learning activities, it can initiate motivation and engagement.<br /><br />

In order to implement each child’s interests, you need to know your each of the children you are caring for. By getting to know them well, you are able to build a good repour with them and have the opportunity to construct positive relationships which I find very important as an educator to create a safe and comfortable environment.<br /><br />

Family Daycare requires you to set an environment where students are relaxed and away from harm. I would enable older children to assist in creating this type of environment by creating a ‘DO’ rules list and a ‘DO NOT’ rules list (Group Rules) so they can feel involved in making the service safe and therefore also have the responsibility to adhere to the rules they have made. In addition, to further provide a child orientated service, I would portray numerous artworks from the children around the room to develop a sense of ownership and belonging for them. My aim is also to assist children to become spontaneous, confident, imaginative, caring learners by providing many opportunities for them to explore different interests, extend both their fine and gross motor skills and provide the rest each individual child needs to thrive in their surroundings. My form of educating children, I feel is based on the consequentialism theory which enables you to act only upon that which produces the better outcome when compared to other alternatives available. Thus, by providing a service for the children according to the Early Years Learning Framework, you are enriching their learning experience as they gain success in the outcomes within the framework. Children will gain the knowledge and skills required as they progress in life and they will be able to enhance their skills, learning, wellbeing, communication, identity and involvement within their world.<br /><br />

Through adapting the use of the consequentialism theory to educating, I would ensure that the consequences of my actions when educating children constructively from the EYLF, serves in the overall well-being and happiness for the children in my care.<br /><br />

My philosophy is one that is focused on each child’s participation and engagement within the activities available that are directed by student interest. I will aim to know each child and their background to form the best possible relationship with them that I can. Child safety and development are of the utmost importance. I will implement strategies to ensure a safe and comfortable environment and deliver learning materials at the most professional level. I aim to portray an excellent role model for children to encourage them on their developmental journey.<br /></p>
